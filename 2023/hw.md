## Continuous Charge Distribution Approximation

In E&M, we often assume that point charges are continuously distributed. This problem addresses the accuracy of this approximation.

A line of length $2L$ is centered on the origin and lies between $-L\le x\le L$. The charge density, $\lambda_o$, on the line is uniform.

If the line is approximated by an odd number of point charges (odd number so a charge is always at the origin) separated by a distance $\Delta$ and is used to compute the approximate electric field $E_{ya}$ on the $y$-axis at $y=L$, how many charges are required so that

$$\left|\frac{E_{ye}(0,L)-E_{ya}(0,L)}{E_{ye}(0,L)}\right|\le 0.01$$

where the exact solution is given by $E_{ye}$. 

You may look up the exact solution, but cite your source. You may use any program or a calculator to solve this problem. Save your program as a file with name <code>HW1_1.ext</code>, where <code>ext</code> is the file extension for your program, e.g., <code>m</code>, <code>py</code>, etc. If you use a spreadsheet, follow the instructions for the following problem.

## Charge on Cylinder

Charge is uniformly distributed on the curved surface of a cylinder of length $h$ and radius $R$. The cylinder is centered on the origin, aligned with the $z$--axis, and has a uniform charge density of $\sigma_o$.

Find $\mathbf{E}(z)$. Prior to doing any calculations, document limiting cases that you can use to check your answer.

## Reading

Next week, Gauss's law will be covered. Find at least one freshman--level textbook and read the sections that cover Gauss's law. Do the same for at least one upper--division undergraduate--level textbook (the references on the syllabus has a list of textbooks, but you may pick your own).

In the next class,

* We will have a general discussion on the the similarities and differences in how Gauss's law is presented and explained.
* I will randomly select students (or groups) to present the solution to a problem. Prepare notes for a 5--7 minute presentation. During your presentation, I will ask the class for clarifications and connections to other problems. You are welcome, and encouraged, to work with one or two other students on this.

# Schedule

## October 12th

* In--class part of midterm (60 minutes, one problem)
* Inductance
* Generalized Ampere's law

## October 5th

* Will post take--home part of mid--term tomorrow or Saturday; due October 19th at 11:59 pm.

## September 28th

* The in--class exam will be one problem related to HW 2.2, 2.3, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.4. Find similar problems in textbooks to practice with. You should know any of the equations used in these problems. The motivation for the problem is to ensure that you can solve problems at this level on your own and have an understanding of the motivation of the steps required for the solution. No non--trivial integration will be required.
* I will hand out take-home part on October 5th and it will be due on October 19th. This problem will be an extension of a numerical problem covered on a previous homework.

## September 21st

* Midterm exam:
  * In--class: Thursday, October 12th from 4:30 – 6:00 pm. This short component will have one or two problems that are similar to the HW problems. 
  * Take--home: Handed out on October 5th and due October 17th. This part will be an extension of HW problem or similar to a HW problem.
* Final exam format will also have an in--class and take--home component. The in--class part is on Thursday, December 7th, from 4:30 – 7:10 pm. The take--home part will be due on December 13th at 9 am.

## September 14th

* To encourage you to review solutions, if I made a comment on a common error in my solutions, I'll mark off for later homeworks for the same error.
* "Quiz" on Gauss's law and field lines
* Discussion of HW #3 problems
* Discussion of numerically solving Laplace's equation in 1-D spherical
* Polarized slab example
* Overview of $\mathbf{D}$ and $\mathbf{P}$

## September 7th

* GitHub (Start at 6:50 pm)
* Discuss HW grading
  * Red circle or red text means I took off for an error.
  * Red circle around blue text - I meant to write text in red. Points were taken off.
  * Blue circle around read text - I meant to write text in blue. Not points off.
* Discuss common HW issues
  * Not using limits to check answer.
  * Using "by symmetry" without explanation. Symmetry is often subtile and I need a diagram to convince me you understood argument.
  * I made many comments on notation. Get in the habit of being careful. This will help avoid embarassment in research presentations and help when you teach.
  * Use of the "answer operator"
* Common HW #2 issue - "sketch" means hand--drawn. "plot" means either draw by hand accurately with graph paper (computing points and then drawing curve) or using software.
* Follow-up to question of using spherical Gaussian surface for derivation for field due to sheet of charge
* Follow-up on "seems like sometimes zooming works, other times not". My answer to the above will in part cover this and I'll also look at a zoom-in with various Gaussian surfaces that can't be used.
* Discuss HW 2.4
* Capacitance
* 1-D Boundary Value Problems
* Discord (Discussion needed)

# Syllabus

## Catalog Description

Classical electromagnetic theory with applications. Topics include electrostatics, magnetic fields and materials, electromagnetic wave propagation, waveguides, transmission lines, radiation, and antennas.

## Format

My primary objective for this course is for students to be able to solve and present advanced electricity and magnetism problems related to the topics given in the catalog description. I will cover topics in chapters 1-6 of [Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics, third edition by Simon Ramo, John R. Whinnery, Theodore Van Duzer, Wiley, 1994](http://www.amazon.ca/Fields-Waves-Communication-Electronics-Simon/dp/0471585513).

Many of the students in this class have had only E&M at the freshman undergraduate level. As a result, not all of the topics in the texbook are covered, and the focus is on a basic understanding of the fundamentals using theoretical and computation problems. In addition, I emphasize problem solving skills: Determining expected features of the solution to a given problem using analogies, limits, or similar problems, using non--dimensionalization to better understand the dependence of solutions on problem parameters, and building computational solutions in small steps with many intermediate checks.

Approximately 1/2 of class time will be a lecture. The rest of the time will be spent with students working on problems or presenting problems using the whiteboard.

The homework assignments will have two parts:

1. Basic problems that cover topics that have not been discussed in class. These problems are intended to prepare the students for the lecture on the topic.
2. Advanced problems that cover topics on the previous HWs basic problems and the lecture.

Homework assignments are due at 11:59 pm on Thursday so you have 3 hours to revise them after class is finished.

## Grading

* Homework: 30%
* Mid-term (part in-class, part take-home): 35%
* Final (part in-class, part take-home): 35%

The course letter grade is nominally determined using > 97: A+, 93 to 96.999: A, 90 to 92.999: A-, 87 to 89.999: B+, 83 to 86.999: B, 80 to 82.999: B-, 70 to 70.999, 60, to 69.999: D, < 60: F. It is quite likely that these grade cut-offs will change downwards.

## Textbook and References

The textbook for this course is [Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics, 3rd edition by Simon Ramo, John R. Whinnery, Theodore Van Duzer, Wiley, 1994](http://www.amazon.ca/Fields-Waves-Communication-Electronics-Simon/dp/0471585513).

You will likely need to reference other textbooks in this course. The following is a partial list of books that you may find useful.

### Mathematical

* A[n Introduction to Fourier Methods and the Laplace Transformation but Philip Franklin](https://www.amazon.com/introduction-Fourier-methods-Laplace-transformation/dp/B0007HQ89I). This short book has many examples related to Maxwell's equations and transmission lines.
* [Fourier Analysis class notes by Peakcock](https://www.roe.ac.uk/~jap/teaching); the [Chapter 12 lecture notes](https://www.roe.ac.uk/japwww/teaching/fourier/fourier1415.pdf) provides a review of the mathematical background and justification for solving ODEs using what Ramo calls "the phasor method".

### Undergraduate-level

* Introduction to Electrodynamics by David J. Griffiths - the most commonly used junior-level undergraduate textbook for physics majors.
* Field and Wave Electromagnetics by David K. Cheng - a commonly used junior-level undergraduate textbook for engineering majors.
* Elements of Electromagnetics by Matthew N. O. Sadiku - a commonly used junior-level undergraduate textbook for engineering majors.
* Electricity and Magnetism (3rd Edition) by Edward M. Purcell and David J. Morin covers the same topics as Griffiths at the same level. If you are looking for an alternative explanation, this textbook will be helpful. The book contains far more examples, discussion, and content than Griffiths. It also includes solutions.
* Schaum's outline of theory and problems of electromagnetics by Joseph A. Edminister is a useful reference for problems with full solutions and summaries of topics. [The 4th edition](https://www.amazon.com/Schaums-Outline-Electromagnetics-4th-Outlines/dp/0071831479/) contains chapters on transmission lines and waveguides.
* Div, Grad, Curl, and All That: An Informal Text on Vector Calculus (4th Edition) by H. M. Schey is an excellent reference for the mathematical background that you need to understand for this course. The book contains a concise and clear review of topics that are covered in a vector calculus course (usually "Calculus III").
* The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Mainly Electromagnetism and Matter, Volume 2, 1977 contains excellent lecture-style expositions on Electricity and Magnetism. The full volume is [available online](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_toc.html).

### Graduate-level

Two textbooks that cover applied E&M topics in detail are
* Microwave Engineering by David M. Pozar.
* [Electromagnetic Fields and Energy by Hermann Haus and James Melcher. RES.6-001, Spring 2008.](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-6-001-electromagnetic-fields-and-energy-spring-2008/front-end-matter/)
* [Electromagnetic Waves and Antennas by Sophocles J. Orfanidis](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/ewa/ewa-2up.pdf). This book is dense and comprehensive, but a supplement such as the course textbook and Microwave Engineering by Pozar is probably needed as a primary reference initially.

Textbooks that cover advanced E&M theory are
* Classical Electrodynamics by David J. Jackson - the most commonly used graduate-level textbook for physics students
* Classical Electricity and Magnetism: Second Edition (Dover Books on Physics) by Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky and Melba Phillips, 2005
* Classical Electromagnetism by Richard Fitzpatrick

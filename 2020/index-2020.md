== Catalog Description ==

Classical electromagnetic theory with applications. Topics include electrostatics, magnetic fields and materials, electromagnetic wave propagation, waveguides, transmission lines, radiation, and antennas.

== Format ==

My primary objective for this course is for students to be able to solve and present advanced electricity and magnetism problems related to the topics given in the catalog description. I will cover topics in chapters 1-6 of [http://www.amazon.ca/Fields-Waves-Communication-Electronics-Simon/dp/0471585513 Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics, third edition by Simon Ramo, John R. Whinnery, Theodore Van Duzer, Wiley, 1994].

I do not plan on providing formal lectures each week. I tried this last semester on WebEx for a 3-hour weekly class, and it was not a good use of time. Instead, I will provide background readings and example problems related to covered topics and homework problems and strongly encourage students to ask questions on Piazza. During class, students will

# ask questions that they have about the reading and/or homework problems (I will provide short mini lectures for certain topics as-needed); and
# answer my questions about the reading and/or homework problems

I will cover each topic given in the catalog description for two weeks. Each week, ~2-4 problems will be assigned. Each homework assignment will have at least one problem that requires a computational solution that is compared with a theoretical result. 

Homework assignments are due at 11:59 pm on Tuesday so that you have 3 hours to revise them after class is finished.

== Piazza ==

On your homework, I will sometimes ask you to post a question to Piazza. See your email for the link. Your questions can be about anything and don't need to be only about homework problems. I encourage you to attempt to answer other students' questions.

You are welcome to post your questions and answers anonymously.

== Grading ==

* Homework: 30%
* Mid-term (take-home): 35%
* Final (take-home): 35%

The course letter grade is nominally determined using > 97: A+, 93 to 96.999: A-, 90 to 92.999: A-, 87 to 89.999: B+, 83 to 86.999: B, 80 to 82.999: B-, 70 to 70.999, 60, to 69.999: D, < 60: F. It is quite likely that these grade cut-offs will change downwards.

== Textbook ==

The textbook for this course is [http://www.amazon.ca/Fields-Waves-Communication-Electronics-Simon/dp/0471585513 Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics, third edition by Simon Ramo, John R. Whinnery, Theodore Van Duzer, Wiley, 1994]

You will likely need to reference other textbooks in this course. The following is a partial list of books that you may find useful.

== Mathematical ==

* An Introduction to Fourier Methods and the Laplace Transformation but Philip Franklin [https://www.amazon.com/introduction-Fourier-methods-Laplace-transformation/dp/B0007HQ89I]. This short book has many examples related to Maxwell's equations and transmission lines.
* Fourier Analysis class by Peakcock [https://www.roe.ac.uk/~jap/teaching/fourier.html]. Chapter 12 of the lecture notes [https://www.roe.ac.uk/japwww/teaching/fourier/fourier1415.pdf] provides a review of the mathematical background and justification for solving ODEs using what Ramo calls "the phasor method".

=== Undergraduate-level ===

* Introduction to Electrodynamics by David J. Griffiths - the most commonly used junior-level undergraduate textbook for physics majors.
* Field and Wave Electromagnetics by David K. Cheng - a commonly used junior-level undergraduate textbook for engineering majors.
* Elements of Electromagnetics by Matthew N. O. Sadiku - a commonly used junior-level undergraduate textbook for engineering majors.
* Electricity and Magnetism (3rd Edition) by Edward M. Purcell and David J. Morin covers the same topics as Griffiths at the same level. If you are looking for an alternative explanation, this textbook will be helpful. The book contains far more examples, discussion, and content than Griffiths. It also includes solutions.
* Schaum's outline of theory and problems of electromagnetics by Joseph A. Edminister is a useful reference for problems with full solutions and summaries of topics. The 4th edition [https://www.amazon.com/Schaums-Outline-Electromagnetics-4th-Outlines/dp/0071831479/] contains chapters on transmission lines and waveguides.
* Div, Grad, Curl, and All That: An Informal Text on Vector Calculus (4th Edition) by H. M. Schey is an excellent reference for the mathematical background that you need to understand for this course. The book contains a concise and clear review of topics that are covered in a vector calculus course (usually "Calculus III").
* The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Mainly Electromagnetism and Matter, Volume 2, 1977 contains excellent lecture-style expositions on Electricity and Magnetism. The full volume is available online at [http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_toc.html].

=== Graduate-level ===

Two textbooks that cover applied E&M topics in detail are
* Microwave Engineering by David M. Pozar.
* Electromagnetic Fields and Energy by Hermann Haus and James Melcher. RES.6-001, Spring 2008.[https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-6-001-electromagnetic-fields-and-energy-spring-2008/front-end-matter/]
* Electromagnetic Waves and Antennas by Sophocles J. Orfanidis [https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/ewa/ewa-2up.pdf]. This book is dense and comprehensive, but a supplement such as the course textbook and Microwave Engineering by Pozar are probably needed as a primary reference initially.

Textbooks that cover advanced E&M theory are
* Classical Electrodynamics by David J. Jackson - the most commonly used graduate-level textbook for physics students
* Classical Electricity and Magnetism: Second Edition (Dover Books on Physics) by Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky and Melba Phillips, 2005
* Classical Electromagnetism by Richard Fitzpatrick

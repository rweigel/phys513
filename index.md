# Syllabus

## Catalog Description

Classical electromagnetic theory with applications. Topics include electrostatics, magnetic fields and materials, electromagnetic wave propagation, waveguides, transmission lines, radiation, and antennas.

## Format

My primary objective for this course is for students to be able to solve and present advanced electricity and magnetism problems related to the topics given in the catalog description. I will cover topics in chapters 1-6 of [Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics, third edition by Simon Ramo, John R. Whinnery, Theodore Van Duzer, Wiley, 1994](http://www.amazon.ca/Fields-Waves-Communication-Electronics-Simon/dp/0471585513).

Approximately 1/2 of class time will be a lecture. The rest of the time will be spent with students working on problems or presenting problems using the whiteboard.

The homework assignments will have two parts:

1. Basic problems that cover topics that have not been discussed in class. These problems are intended to prepare the students for the lecture on the topic.
2. Advanced problems that cover topics on the previous HWs basic problems and the lecture.

Homework assignments are due at 11:59 pm on Thursday so you have 3 hours to revise them after class is finished.

## Grading

* Homework: 30%
* Mid-term (part in-class, part take-home): 35%
* Final (part in-class, part take-home): 35%

The course letter grade is nominally determined using > 97: A+, 93 to 96.999: A, 90 to 92.999: A-, 87 to 89.999: B+, 83 to 86.999: B, 80 to 82.999: B-, 70 to 70.999, 60, to 69.999: D, < 60: F. It is quite likely that these grade cut-offs will change downwards.

## Textbook and References

The textbook for this course is [Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics, 3rd edition by Simon Ramo, John R. Whinnery, Theodore Van Duzer, Wiley, 1994](http://www.amazon.ca/Fields-Waves-Communication-Electronics-Simon/dp/0471585513).

You will likely need to reference other textbooks in this course. The following is a partial list of books that you may find useful.

### Mathematical

* A[n Introduction to Fourier Methods and the Laplace Transformation but Philip Franklin](https://www.amazon.com/introduction-Fourier-methods-Laplace-transformation/dp/B0007HQ89I). This short book has many examples related to Maxwell's equations and transmission lines.
* [Fourier Analysis class notes by Peakcock](https://www.roe.ac.uk/~jap/teaching); the [Chapter 12 lecture notes](https://www.roe.ac.uk/japwww/teaching/fourier/fourier1415.pdf) provides a review of the mathematical background and justification for solving ODEs using what Ramo calls "the phasor method".

### Undergraduate-level

* Introduction to Electrodynamics by David J. Griffiths - the most commonly used junior-level undergraduate textbook for physics majors.
* Field and Wave Electromagnetics by David K. Cheng - a commonly used junior-level undergraduate textbook for engineering majors.
* Elements of Electromagnetics by Matthew N. O. Sadiku - a commonly used junior-level undergraduate textbook for engineering majors.
* Electricity and Magnetism (3rd Edition) by Edward M. Purcell and David J. Morin covers the same topics as Griffiths at the same level. If you are looking for an alternative explanation, this textbook will be helpful. The book contains far more examples, discussion, and content than Griffiths. It also includes solutions.
* Schaum's outline of theory and problems of electromagnetics by Joseph A. Edminister is a useful reference for problems with full solutions and summaries of topics. [The 4th edition](https://www.amazon.com/Schaums-Outline-Electromagnetics-4th-Outlines/dp/0071831479/) contains chapters on transmission lines and waveguides.
* Div, Grad, Curl, and All That: An Informal Text on Vector Calculus (4th Edition) by H. M. Schey is an excellent reference for the mathematical background that you need to understand for this course. The book contains a concise and clear review of topics that are covered in a vector calculus course (usually "Calculus III").
* The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Mainly Electromagnetism and Matter, Volume 2, 1977 contains excellent lecture-style expositions on Electricity and Magnetism. The full volume is [available online](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_toc.html).

### Graduate-level

Two textbooks that cover applied E&M topics in detail are
* Microwave Engineering by David M. Pozar.
* [Electromagnetic Fields and Energy by Hermann Haus and James Melcher. RES.6-001, Spring 2008.](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-6-001-electromagnetic-fields-and-energy-spring-2008/front-end-matter/)
* [Electromagnetic Waves and Antennas by Sophocles J. Orfanidis](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/ewa/ewa-2up.pdf). This book is dense and comprehensive, but a supplement such as the course textbook and Microwave Engineering by Pozar is probably needed as a primary reference initially.

Textbooks that cover advanced E&M theory are
* Classical Electrodynamics by David J. Jackson - the most commonly used graduate-level textbook for physics students
* Classical Electricity and Magnetism: Second Edition (Dover Books on Physics) by Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky and Melba Phillips, 2005
* Classical Electromagnetism by Richard Fitzpatrick

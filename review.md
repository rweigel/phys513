I am by nature a researcher and experimenter. How I teach is continuously evolving and follows from doing small experiments to making small changes each semester.

Please provide me with feedback that will help me with this evolution. Don't be afraid to be critical. I have a long list of criticisms of my own.

Sections 1 and 2 below are in reference to the course evaluation. Check your student email.

# Free Response

In the free responses, please consider providing feedback on how I handle this (and other graduate-level courses):
* Brief overview
* Basic HW that requires you to read and find references. Generally, no specific references beyond those on the syllabus are suggested. The student is expected to find (and benefit from learning to research) other sources
* Did I give enough feedback on your HWs? I never feel that I give enough feedback. And if you've ever taught, you'll understand that grading HWs and providing feedback is the one thing you would rather not do and for which there is never enough time.

My concerns about this course:
* Did I cover enough material? I prefer quality over quantity, and I decide what and how to cover based on what I learn from asking questions in class.
* Were there topics you would have preferred I covered or covered more/less of?

# Evaluation Form

The following is the list of questions on the course evaluation form. If you select "5", please comment on what I could do to have a higher rating. See my italicized comments in this list for specific feedback I am looking for.

* I completed all assigned tasks before each class.
* I consistently contributed to class activities/discussions. _Is there anything I could do to get you to contribute more, assuming you want to?_
* I gained an understanding of the main concepts in this course. _Which concepts did you gain the most/least understanding of?_
* I learned through the variety of learning opportunities (e.g. assignments, projects, papers, discussions, group work, peer review, exams) provided. _Would you like to have had other learning opportunities? If so, which?_
* I found the instructor's feedback helpful for learning. _Do you like the one-on-one feedback I used early in the semester?_
* I learned due to the instructor's teaching methods/style. _What parts in particular were good/bad?_
* The instructor created an environment that facilitated my engagement with course content. _What did or did not facilitate?_
* The instructor encouraged expression of diverse perspectives.
* The instructor offered opportunities for students to provide feedback on the course. _I didn't do this explicitly, but several students occasionally provided indirect feedback. If you want more, what is your preference?_
* The instructor offered opportunities to meet outside of class time, such as virtual or in-person office hours
* The instructor used technologies and/or resources/tools that increased my engagement with course content _I'd like to do more of this, but I have run out of ideas_
* The course organization supported my learning.
* The instructor clearly communicated course requirements to students. _Because it is a graduate class, I typically do not give students a sense of their grades continuously throughout the semester. The reason is tradition, and also I don't want the course to be about learning as opposed to "getting points"_
* The instructor clearly presented the course content. _There were several topics that I could have done better on. I'm interested in hearing your opinion on this._

# When you are done

I am going to give you 30 minutes to fill out the form. If you finish early, please start working on the following problem.

One end of a coaxial cable of arbitrary length and characteristic impedance $Z_o$ is connected to an AC power source. The other end is connected to a load with impedance $Z_L$.

<img src="figures/Transmission_Line_Load_Terminated.svg" width="40%"/>

Show that $|\rho|=1$ if
1. $Z_L=0$ (short at end)
2. $Z_0/Z_L=0$ (end is open)
3. $Z_L=ib$ (that is, the load has no resistive component, and the reactive component has a magnitude of $b$)

Show that if $Z_L=0$,
1. $|\widetilde{V}(x)|=0$ at $x=0, -\lambda/2, - 2\lambda/2, ...$
2. $|\widetilde{V}(x)|=0$ has maxima when $\beta x$ is an odd multiple of $\pi/2$
3. $|\widetilde{I}(x)|=0$ has maxima when  $|\widetilde{V}(x)|=0$
4. $I(x,t)$ and $V(x,t)$ are shifted in time by $90^\circ$
5. ${\text{max }|\widetilde{V}(x)|}/{{\text{max }|\widetilde{I}(x)}|}=Z_o$

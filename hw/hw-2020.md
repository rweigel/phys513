# HW #2

Due Tuesday, September 8th at 11:59 pm, but you are expected to have it mostly finished before we meet in person on Tuesday.

## Laplace' Equation in Two Dimensions - Analytical

A long pipe runs parallel to the \(z\)-axis as shown in the figure. The sides are labeled with subscripts \(l\), \(r\), \(t\), \(b\) for the left, right, top, and bottom. These sites are held at potentials \(V_l\), \(V_r\), \(V_t\), and \(V_b\).

[[Image:long_pipe.png]]

In the following problem, you will be asked to verify the exact solution in Table 1.20 of the textbook.

In this problem, you will derive a general solution for the potential inside of the pipe, \(\Phi(x,y)\) that depends on \(x_o\), \(y_o\), \(V_l\), \(V_r\), \(V_t\), and \(V_b\).

I have sent a PDF of Chapter 3 of Griffiths to the Piazza email list, which covers problems related to this. In addition, I have [[Notes|notes]] that fill in the mathematical gaps in Griffiths' examples.

1. Assume only \(V_l\) is nonzero. Find the potential inside of the pipe and call it \(\Phi_l(x,y)\).

2. Assume only \(V_b\) is nonzero. Find the potential inside of the pipe and call it \(\Phi_b(x,y)\). Finding this answer should be easy.

3. Assume only \(V_t\) is nonzero. Find the potential inside of the pipe and call it \(\Phi_t(x,y)\). 

4. Assume only \(V_r\) is nonzero. Find the potential inside of the pipe and call it \(\Phi_r(x,y)\). Finding this answer should be easy.

**Answer**

The function 

$$\psi_l(x,y) = A_n\sin(n\pi y/y_0)\sinh\left[n\pi(x-x_0)/y_0\right]$$

satisfies \(\nabla^2\psi=0\) and three of the four boundary conditions. I've skipped the steps used in the notes to show this - after you've done the problem a few times, you can usually skip those steps and write down a function that satisfied Laplace's equation and three of the four boundaries that are at zero potential. To satisfy the non-zero boundary condition, a Fourier sum is needed:

$$\psi_l(x,y)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty A_n\sin(n\pi y/y_0)\sinh\left[n\pi(x-x_0)/y_0\right]$$

Standard Fourier analysis gives

$$A_n=-\frac{4V}{n\pi\sinh (n\pi y_0/x_0)}\quad n=1,3,...$$
$$A_n=0\quad n=2,4,...$$

So the solution is

$$\psi_l(x,y)=\frac{4V}{\pi}\sum_{n=1,3,...}^\infty \frac{\sin(n\pi y/y_0)}{n\sinh (n\pi y_0/x_0)}\sinh\left[n\pi(x_0-x)/y_0\right]$$

The solution to the problem where only \(\psi_r\) is nonzero can be obtained by replacing \(x\) with \(x_0-x\) in the problem where only \(\psi_l\) is non-zero:

$$\psi_r(x,y)=\psi_l(x_0-x,y)=\frac{4V}{\pi}\sum_{n=1,3,...}^\infty \frac{\sin(n\pi y/y_0)}{n\sinh (n\pi y_0/x_0)}\sinh(n\pi x/y_0)$$

The solution to the problem where only \(\psi_t\) is nonzero can be obtained by swapping the coordinate labels in the problem where only \(\psi_l\) is non-zero:

$$\psi_t(x,y)=\frac{4V}{\pi}\sum_{n=1,3,...}^\infty \frac{\sin(n\pi x/x_0)}{n\sinh (n\pi x_0/y_0)}\sinh\left[n\pi(y_0-y)/x_0\right]$$

The solution to the problem where only \(\psi_b\) is nonzero can be obtained by replacing \(y\) with \(y_0-y\) in the problem where only \(\psi_t\) is non-zero:

$$\psi_b(x,y)=\frac{4V}{\pi}\sum_{n=1,3,...}^\infty \frac{\sin(n\pi x/x_0)}{n\sinh (n\pi x_0/y_0)}\sinh(n\pi y/x_0)$$
|}

Claim: The general solution for this problem is

$$\Phi(x,y) = \Phi_l(x,y)+\Phi_r(x,y)+\Phi_t(x,y)+\Phi_b(x,y)$$

5. Justify this claim.

**Answer**

The short answer is "superposition and uniqueness". The associated explanation is that each of the individual potentials \(\Phi_i\) satisfy Laplace's equation \(\nabla^2\Phi_i=0\), so their sum also satisfies Laplace's equation, which follows from

$$\nabla^2\Phi=\nabla^2\Big(\Phi_l(x,y)+\Phi_r(x,y)+\Phi_t(x,y)+\Phi_b(x,y)\Big)=\nabla^2\Phi_l(x,y)+\nabla^2\Phi_r(x,y)+\nabla^2\Phi_t(x,y)+\nabla^2\Phi_b(x,y)=0$$

The sum of the solutions \(\Phi\) also satisfies the boundary conditions of the problem. Therefore, by uniqueness, the general solution is given by \(\Phi\). 

6. Can Gauss' law be used in any way at any location to check your analytic answers derived above? If yes, provide details of your check. The textbook does not cover the fundamentals of Gauss' law in great detail. As background reading, I suggest the Gauss' law section of any upper-division E&M text for physicists or engineers.

Upload your solution to your GitHub account as <code>HW2_1.pdf</code>.

**Answer**

This was discussed extensively in class.

## Laplace' Equation in Two Dimensions - Numerical

1. Verify the numbers in the Step 1 column of Table 1.20 of the textbook. Show your calculations on a piece of paper. Upload your solution to your GitHub account as <code>HW2_2_1.pdf</code>.

2. Verify the numbers in the Step 1 column of Table 1.20 of the textbook using any software (spreadsheet, MATLAB, Python, etc.). Upload your solution to your GitHub account as <code>HW2_2_2.ext</code>, where <code>ext</code> is the file name extension for the software that you used.

**Answer**

See https://github.com/rweigel/phys513, which generates all of the columns in Table 1.20. The maximum difference between my results and the results in the columns for steps 1-5 is 0.03 (for step 4, $\Phi_3$). I don't get the same answer as that in the "Correct Potentials" column of Table 1.20. Based on the testing that was done in the code, I conclude that the values in the book are wrong.

3. Suppose that you were given only the values for the potentials of the surfaces and the potentials at the four interior grid points shown in Figure 1.20a of the textbook. Describe an algorithm for drawing the field lines given only this information. You do not need to implement the algorithm and there is no "correct" answer. Upload your solution to your GitHub account as <code>HW2_2_3.pdf</code>.

**Answer**

As covered in HW #1, to draw a field line, one computes the direction of the the field at a starting point and takes a small step in this direction. Because we don't know the electric field at all points in the domain, one can do a bilinear interpolation using the four nearest points to the point where we want to know the electric field.

# Capacitance

When using the Boundary Value method, one must start with the general solution to Laplace's equation in the appropriate coordinate system. In the following, the general solution to Laplace's equation is derived for the case where the potential only varies in the \(x\)-direction, so \(\psi=\psi(x)\). In this case, Laplace's equation

$$\nabla^2\psi=0$$

can be solved using the following steps:

$$\nabla^2\psi(x) = \frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x} = \frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = 0$$

(I am going to ask for the justification of the above steps in class, but you do not need to turn in your answer.)

The second derivative \({d^2\psi}/{dx^2}\) can be written as

$$\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{d\psi}{dx}\right) = 0$$

As a result, you can conclude that the term in parenthesis must be a constant because the derivative of a constant is zero.

$$\left(\frac{d\psi}{dx}\right)=C_1$$

This equation can be directly integrated. The result is the general solution to Laplace's equation when the potential only varies in the \(x\)-direction that has two unknown constants:

$$\psi(x) = C_1x + C_2$$

When there is only variation in the radial cylindrical direction \(s\) or the spherical radial direction \(r\), similar steps are followed to find an equation for \(\psi(s)\) or \(\psi(r)\) that have two unknown constants. You can look up the general solutions for these cases, but ideally you would know how derive them (... and I'll ask about the derivation in class).

=== Large Parallel Plates ===

Two large, conducting, and parallel plates are separated by a distance \(d\). The plates have a surface area of \(A\). Find the capacitance using both the Gauss's law method and the Boundary Value method.

=== Long Coaxial Cylinders ===

Two long conducting coaxial cylinders have inner and outer radii of \(b\), and \(c\), respecitively. Find the capacitance per unit length using both the Gauss's law method and the Boundary Value method.

=== Concentric Spherical Shells ===

Two concentric and conducting spherical shells have inner and outer radii of \(b\), and \(c\), respecitively. Find the capacitance using both the Gauss's law method and the Boundary Value method.

=== Discussion Questions ===

You do not need to turn in your answer to this part. However, I am going to ask you in class for your answer; there is no grade associated with your answer.

==== Equal and Opposite ====

In the first sentence of this homework set, I wrote that an equal and opposite amount of charge will appear on each conductor when they are connected by a battery assuming that they were initially uncharged. Is this true for any two conductors connected by a battery, independent of their shape? (Assume that both conductors are initially uncharged.) Justify your answer.

==== Justification of Steps ====

What is the justification for each of these equalities?

$$\nabla^2\psi(x) = \frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x} = \frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}$$

==== Approximation ====

Of the three capacitances computed, which are approximate answers and which are exact? Under what conditions do the approximate answers become near exact?

==== Capacitors in Series ====

The formula for capacitors in series is

$$\frac{1}{C_{eq}}=\frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}$$

Show how this formula results from the Gauss's law method when a charge of \(+Q\) and \(-Q\) is placed as shown on the outer plates of two parallel plate capacitors connected in series. The capacitors have separation distances \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) and areas \(A_1\) and \(A_2\).

== Potential Due to Point Charges ==

In this problem, all of the positions are on the \(x\)-axis.

Two point charges \(q_2\) and \(q_3\) are fixed at \(x_2\) and \(x_3\). 

1. How much work \(W_1\) does it take to move a charge \(q_1\) from infinity to a position \(x_1\)?

Two point charges \(q_1\) and \(q_3\) are fixed at \(x_1\) and \(x_3\).

2. How much work \(W_2\) does it take to move a charge \(q_2\) from infinity to a position \(x_2\)?

Two point charges \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) are fixed at \(x_1\) and \(x_2\).

3. How much work \(W_3\) does it take to move a charge \(q_3\) from infinity to a position \(x_3\)?

(If this problem seems easy, it is; it is not a trick question. The motivation for asking is that I am going to show you how one can build upon the answer to compute capacitance. The first question that I'll ask in class is what the potential is at \(x_1\), \(x_2\), and \(x_3\).)

# Computing Magnetic Field and Flux

1. Write a function that returns the magnetic field computed using a discrete approximation to the Biot-Savart integral. The inputs to the function should be a 3-D location in space, an arbitrary number of 3-D points on a wire, and the current in the wire. Assume that the given points on the wire are connected by straight wire segments of length \(L\) and treat these segments as the differential lengths in the Biot-Savart integrand. That is, the magnetic field for each segment \(i\) should be computed as

$$\mathbf{B}_i = \frac{\mu_oI}{4\pi}\frac{\mathbf{L}_i\times \mathbf{R}}{R^3}$$

where the notation is that used on page 74 of the textbook. As an example, in MATLAB notation, I should be able to call your function as in the following script

 p = [0, 0, 0];
 % Each row of XYZ is a point on a wire.
 XYZ = [1, 1, 0;-1, 1, 0;-1, -1, 0;1, -1, 0];
 I = 1;
 
 B = HW4_BiotSavart(p, XYZ, I)
 
 % B is an array with three elements corresponding to Bx, By, and Bz at (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)

Name the function <code>HW4_BiotSavart</code> and save it in a file named <code>HW4_BiotSavart.ext</code> 

2. You want to convince me that your program is correctly implementing the Biot-Savart formula and can be used to approximate the magnetic field for an arbitrarily shaped wire provided that enough points on the wire are given. Create a script named <code>HW4_Check.m</code> that generates tables and/or plots that make the case.

3. Consider two circular current loops of radius 1 m. One is centered on the origin, carries a current of 1 A, and lies in the \(z=0\) plane. The other is in the \(z=2\) m plane and the \(z\)-axis passes through its center. Compute the magnetic flux through the shifted current loop using the function created in part 1. Create a script named <code>HW4_Flux.m</code> that prints the magnetic flux.

In class, I will ask you to give a brief summary of your solution.

**Answer**

My code is located at https://github.com/rweigel/phys513

I looked up the analytic answer for the off-axis magnetic field of a circular current loop [http://www.netdenizen.com/emagnet/offaxis/iloopoffaxis.htm]. The off-axis field requires an integration of an elliptic integral.

To compute the flux, I considered the integral that I would set up to compute the exact answer. To do this, I need \(B_z(s_i,0,z)\) at \(z=2\) and \(s=ds, 2ds, ..., 1\). The flux through an annulus of radius \(s_i\) with width \(ds\) is then

$$\Phi_M^i = 2\pi s_i ds B_z(s_i)$$

As the number of annuli increases, the flux should approach the exact answer. This is how one would compute the flux using ordinary integration.

# Boundary Value Derivation and Maxwell's Equations

In class, I described simple or familar problems that I use to explain physically \(\oint\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}=Q_{enc}/\epsilon_o\), \(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{E}=\rho/\epsilon_o\), \(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{E}=0\), \(\mathbf{E}=-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\Psi\) and how the tangential and perpendicular compoents of \(\mathbf{E}\) vary across any boundary surface.

I would like you to do the same for \(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{B}=0\), \(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{B}=\mu_o\mathbf{J}\), and \(\mathbf{B}=-\boldsymbol{\nabla}\Psi_M\), where \(\Psi_M\) is a magnetic scalar potential that can be defined under certain conditions. In addition, describe examples that help explain how the tangential and perpendicular components of \(\mathbf{B}\) vary across any boundary surface and how these examples help explain the associated derivation.

I do not want your answers to be the standard derivations and explanations given in textbooks (although hybrid explanations are acceptable). I want your answers to reflect how you understand and interpret the equations.

Save your answers in a file named <code>HW5_1.pdf</code> and upload it to GitHub. I will ask you to show your answers in class, and I will ask you questions about what you wrote.

# Poynting Theorem

In the diagram, an RC circuit is shown. The capacitor plates are circular and have a radius \(b\). The smaller dotted rectangle represents the cross-section of a cylindrical volume with a radius of \(r_s\) and a height \(h_s\); \(h_s < d\). The larger dotted rectangle represents the cross-section of a cylindrical volume with a radius \(r_l\) and a height \(h_l\); \(d \lt h_l\lt l\).

[[Image:RC_Circuit.png|500px]]

Equation (6) on Page 140 of the textbook is Poynting's theorem for linear and time-invariant media.

1. Using the small cylinder as the volume in Poynting's theorem, show how equation (6) is satisfied after the circuit is closed. State all assumptions that you used for any of the lengths given in the problem and why you made the assumption (e.g., state what simplification the assumptions allowed).

2. Using the large cylinder as the volume in Poynting's theorem, show how equation (6) is satisfied after the circuit is closed. State all assumptions that you used for any of the lengths given in the problem and why you made the assumption (e.g., state what simplification the assumptions allowed).

# Wave Superposition

An antenna can create a plane wave in the form

$$E_x=A\cos(\omega t-kx+\delta)$$

where \(A\) and \(\delta\) are adjustable.

By trial-and-error, it is found that two antenna can create a desired signal for certain settings of \(A\) and \(\delta\) on each. By superposition, the plane wave can be written as

$$E_x=A_1\cos(\omega t-kx+\delta_1) + A_2\cos(\omega t-kx+\delta_2)$$

It is desired to create this plane wave with one antenna, that is,

$$E_x=A_3\cos(\omega t-kx+\delta_3)$$

If possible, what should the values of \(A_3\) and \(\delta_3\) be in terms of \(A_1\), \(A_2\), \(\delta_1\) and \(\delta_2\) in order to create the same same waveform as the two antenna?

# Wave Equation Derivation

1. \(E_y(x,t)\), \(E_z(x,t)\), \(B_y(x,t)\), and \(B_z(x,t)\) each individually obey a wave equation of the form
</p>

$${\partial ^2 f\over \partial u^2} = {1 \over c^2}{\partial ^2 f\over \partial t^2}$$

where \(u\) is a placeholder for one of the cartesian variables and \(f\) is any one of \(E_y(x,t)\), \(E_z(x,t)\), \(B_y(x,t)\), and \(B_z(x,t)\). 

2. Does it follow that \(E_x(x,t)=B_x(x,t)=0\)? Justify your answer.

3. Show explicitly how your answer to 1. is consistent with

$$\boldsymbol \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = {1 \over c^2}{\partial ^2 \mathbf{E}\over \partial t^2}\qquad\boldsymbol \nabla^2 \mathbf{B} = {1 \over c^2}{\partial ^2 \mathbf{B}\over \partial t^2}$$

Provide a very brief justification for each step used to show this.

# Wave Equation Solutions

<p>
1. Show that 

$$\mathbf{E}=E_{ox}\cos(k_zz-\omega t + \delta_x)\hat{\mathbf{x}}$$

satisfies

$$\boldsymbol \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = {1 \over c^2}{\partial ^2 \mathbf{E}\over \partial t^2}$$

and

$$\mathbf{B}=B_{ox}\cos(k\_zz-\omega t + \delta'\_x)\hat{\mathbf{x}}+B_{oy}\cos(k\_zz-\omega t + \delta'\_y)\hat{\mathbf{y}}$$

satisfies

$$\boldsymbol \nabla^2 \mathbf{B} = {1 \over c^2}{\partial ^2 \mathbf{B}\over \partial t^2}$$

Provided that one or more of the constants \(k_z\), \(\omega\), \(E_{ox}\), \(B_{ox}\), \(B_{oy}\), \(\delta_x\), \(\delta'_x\), and \(\delta'_y\) are related. State the required relationships.

2. Show that one or more of the constants \(k_z\), \(\omega\), \(E_{ox}\), \(B_{ox}\), \(B_{oy}\), \(\delta_x\), \(\delta'_x\), and \(\delta'_y\) must be either related to each other or zero in order for the both \(\mathbf{B}\) and \(\mathbf{E}\) given above to be consistent with Maxwell's equations.

3. If \(\mathbf{E}\) is instead given by (the \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}\) below should be \(\hat{\mathbf{y}}\). If you have not started this problem, use \(\hat{\mathbf{y}}\); I'll accept answers for either choice.).

$$\mathbf{E}=E_{oy}\cos(k_zz-\omega t + \delta_y)\hat{\mathbf{x}}$$

show that one or more of the constants \(k_z\), \(\omega\), \(E_{oy}\), \(B_{ox}\), \(B_{oy}\), \(\delta_y\), \(\delta'_x\), and \(\delta'_y\) must be either related to each other or zero in order for the both \(\mathbf{B}\) and \(\mathbf{E}\) to be consistent with Maxwell's equations.

4. Using the definition

$$\mathbf{k}=k_x\hat{\mathbf{x}} + k_y\hat{\mathbf{y}}+k_z\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

show that your results from 2. and 3. are consistent with

$$\mathbf{B}={1 \over c}\hat{\mathbf{k}}\times \mathbf{E}$$

# Complex Form

1. Using the definitions

$$\mathbf{E}\equiv Re\left[\widetilde{\mathbf{E}}e^{-i(\omega t-\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r})}\right]$$

$$\mathbf{B}\equiv Re\left[\widetilde{\mathbf{B}}e^{-i(\omega t-\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r})}\right]\,,$$

$$\mathbf{k}\equiv k_x\hat{\mathbf{x}} + k_y\hat{\mathbf{y}}+k_z\hat{\mathbf{z}}$$

$$\mathbf{r}\equiv x\hat{\mathbf{x}} + y\hat{\mathbf{y}} + z\hat{\mathbf{z}}\,,$$

where \(\widetilde{\mathbf{E}}\) and \(\widetilde{\mathbf{B}}\) are vectors with complex constants as components,

show that it follows from \(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \mathbf{E}=-{\partial \mathbf{B}}/{\partial t}\) that

$$\widetilde{\mathbf{B}}={1 \over c}\hat{\mathbf{k}}\times \widetilde{\mathbf{E}}$$

Explain how

$$\mathbf{B}={1 \over c}\hat{\mathbf{k}}\times \mathbf{E}$$

and

$$\widetilde{\mathbf{B}}={1 \over c}\hat{\mathbf{k}}\times \widetilde{\mathbf{E}}$$

are related.

# Inductance Calculation

In the last HW, problem 4.6e was assigned. In the problem, it was stated that the internal inductances per length to use were

$$\frac{L_{ia}}{2\pi a}\,\,\text{and}\,\,\frac{L_{ib}}{2\pi b}$$

1. Derive the formula for the internal inductances per unit length assuming current is uniformly distributed throughout the cross-section of the conductors. Then derive the inductances per unit length assuming that the current is distributed uniformly only to a depth of \(\delta\) and compare the result with the two equations given above.

**Answer**

The internal inductance of the outer cylinder of length \(l\) with an inner radius \(b\) and an outer radius \(c\) of a co-axial cable is derived in Example 2.17 (page 108) of Ramo.  The energy method was used. The result is

$$\mathcal{L}_{ib}=\frac{\mu l}{2\pi}\left[\frac{c^4\ln c/b}{(c^2-b^2)^2}-\frac{b^2-3c^2}{4(c^2-b^2)}\right]$$

The dimensionless term in square braces is better written in terms of the dimensionless ratio \(c/b\):

$$\mathcal{L}_{ib}=\frac{\mu l}{2\pi}\left[\frac{(c/b)^4\ln c/b}{[(c/b)^2-1]^2}-\frac{1-3(c/b)^2}{4[(c/b)^2-1]}\right]$$

Note that this differs from the internal inductance of a cylindrical shell with inner radius \(b\) and outer radius \(c\) because the return current that flows in the opposite direction along the axis of the cylinder reduces the magnetic field.

To write \(\mathcal{L}_{ib}\) in terms of \(\delta\), define \(\delta = c-b\). 

Defining \(x\equiv \delta/b\) gives \(c/b=1+x\) and

$$\mathcal{L}_{ib}=\frac{\mu l}{2\pi}\left[\frac{(1+x)^4\ln x}{[(1+x)^2-1]^2}-\frac{1-3(1+x)^2}{4[(1+x)^2-1]}\right]$$

The series expansion of this around \(x=0\) can be found using \(\ln(1+x) = 1+x+ ...\) and \(1+x^n = 1+nx + ...\) or a program such as WolframAlpha 

The result [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=series+%281%2F%28%281%2Bx%29%5E2+-+1%29%29+%28+%281%2Bx%29%5E4*ln%281%2Bx%29+%2F+%28%281%2Bx%29%5E2+-+1%29+-+%281%2Bx%29%5E2%2F2+%29+-+1%2F4] is

$$\mathcal{L}_{ib}=\frac{\mu l}{2\pi}\left(\frac{x}{3}-\frac{x^3}{30}+...\right)$$

or

$$\mathcal{L}_{ib}\simeq\frac{\mu (\delta/3)}{2\pi b}l$$

In problem 4.6e, the equation for inductance per unit length for very high frequencies (so \(\delta\) is small) was given as

$$\frac{L_{ib}}{2\pi b}$$

As a result, we have found the origin of this equation and conclude that \(L_{ib}\), referred to as the "internal inductance per square", is \(L_{ib}=\mu \delta/3\).

----

The internal inductance of the inner cylinder is

$$L_{ia}=\frac{\mu}{8\pi}$$

When the current on the inner conductor is confined to radii of \(b-\delta\) to \(b\), its internal inductance is found using the formula for \(L_{ib}\) with the replacement of \(c/b\) with \(a/(a-\delta)=1/(1-x)\), where \(x\equiv \delta/a\).

$$\mathcal{L}_{ia}=\frac{\mu l}{2\pi}\left[\frac{(1-x)^{-4}[\ln (1-x)^{-1}]}{[(1-x)^{-2}-1]^2}-\frac{1-3(1-x)^{-2}}{4[(1-x)^{-2}-1]}\right]$$

In comparison, in terms of the small ratio \(x\equiv\delta/b\),

$$\mathcal{L}_{ib}=\frac{\mu l}{2\pi}\left[\frac{(1+x)^4\ln x}{[(1+x)^2-1]^2}-\frac{1-3(1+x)^2}{4[(1+x)^2-1]}\right]$$

Given that for small \(x\), \((1-x)^{-n}\simeq 1 + nx\) and \((1+x)^{n}\simeq 1 + nx\), the \(L_{ia}\) series expansion for small \(x\) is expected to match to leading order the result for \(\mathcal{L}_{ib}\) for small \(x\). The expansion is [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=series+%28%28%281-x%29%5E%28-4%29+ln+%281%2F%281-x%29%29%29%29%2F%28%28%281-x%29%5E%28-2%29-1%29%5E2%29+%2B+%281-3*%281-x%29%5E%28-2%29%29%2F%284*%28%281-x%29%5E%28-2%29-1%29%29+at+x%3D0]

$$\mathcal{L}_{ia}=\frac{\mu l}{2\pi}\left[\frac{x}{3} + \frac{x^2}{3} + ...\right]$$

As a result, we conclude that \(L_{ia}=\mu \delta/3\), which is the same as \(L_{ib}\).

----

The statement "internal inductance per square" is opaque. I suspect that it refers to the fact that the internal inductance of one of the two large slabs shown in the top diagram of [https://www.mathcha.io/editor/1lB03iV1HvqhM0zwZgirMVgBxiJgJP1Ki87D7YJ] is \((\mu \delta /3) (l/w)\). If the slabs are square, then \(l=w\).

2. Derive the formula for the external inductance of a coaxial cable.

**Answer**

The external inductance is the familiar formula

$$L=\frac{\mu l}{2\pi}\ln\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$$

3. When the gap in the coaxial cable is small and the radius \(a\) is large relative to the gap, the magnetic field is nearly constant in the gap region. As a result, it is expected that the external inductance per unit length \(l\) should be related to that for two parallel planes with area \(2\pi a l\). Define the gap distance as \(\delta = b-a\) and assume \(\delta/a \ll 1\) and show that the external inductance in this approximation is related to the external inductance of two parallel planes with areas of \(2\pi a l\) (the current on the planes flows parallel to the direction of \(l\)). 

**Answer**

Schematically, we are to show the inductance for the geometry on the left of the bottom figure at [https://www.mathcha.io/editor/1lB03iV1HvqhM0zwZgirMVgBxiJgJP1Ki87D7YJ] approximates that on the right.

Using\(b=a+\delta\) and plugging this into the result of 2. gives

$$L=\frac{\mu l}{2\pi}\ln\left(\frac{a + \delta}{a}\right)=\frac{\mu l}{2\pi}\ln\left(1+\frac{ \delta}{a}\right)$$

For \(\delta/a \rightarrow 0\), 

$$L=\mu l\frac{\delta}{2\pi a}$$

When the gap is small relative to \(a\), the magnetic field is nearly constant in the volume between the cylinders. Based on the fact that inductance is related to the volume integral of \(B^2\), it is expected that the inductance in this limit should match the inductance of the following configuration.

The internal magnetic field for the bottom right configuration at [https://www.mathcha.io/editor/1lB03iV1HvqhM0zwZgirMVgBxiJgJP1Ki87D7YJ] is \(\mu I/w\). Using the energy method

$$\frac{1}{2}LI^2 = \frac{1}{2\mu}\int B^2 dv = \frac{\mu_o}{2}\frac{l\delta}{w} I^2$$

so that

$$L=\mu l\frac{\delta}{w}$$

This matches the external inductance of the cylinder when \(w=2\pi a\).

# Transmission Line/Wave Propagation I

In the previous HW, you derived the relationship between the electric and magnetic fields for a monochromatic plane wave propagating in free space. In class, I derived the equations that related the electric and magnetic fields for the case where a plane wave propagating to the right encountered a change in either the permeability or permittivity (or both). The relationship between the electric fields in the two regions at the interface is \(E_1 = E_2\).

In region 1, the electric field is composed of a forward and backward propagating wave, \(E_1=E_1^{+}+E_1^{-}\). In region 2, the electric field is composed only of a forward propagating wave, \(E_2=E_2^{+}\).

In the image at [https://github.com/rweigel/phys513/blob/master/fdtd/figures/HW8_2.pdf], the 1-D wave propagation code used on a previous HW was used to create a monochromatic plane wave that propagates to the right and encounters a change in \(\epsilon\) by a factor of \(9\). The code that generated this image is <code>fdtd1d.m</code> at [https://github.com/rweigel/phys513/blob/master/fdtd/]. Based on the parameters used in the code, compute \(E_1^{+}\) and \(E_1^{-}\) and add lines for these at the time step in the image shown.

# Flux Linkage

The top diagram at [https://www.mathcha.io/editor/K7MwPfWBUm3TXq8oNgtvEkvPecMwO6Oeu45ljV] shows a rectangular duct that carries a net current of \(I_1 = K_1l\) in the direction shown. A series of current supplies along the gap is driving the current. The surface of the duct has a small enough thickness that the current can be treated as flowing on a sheet.

=== === 

Assuming \(w \gg h_1\) and \(l \gg h_1\), use Ampere's law to find the magnetic field inside and outside of the duct. Show the Amperian loop and justify your steps.

**Answer**

As shown in class, Ampere's law can be used to show that the magnetic field due to a large sheet of current is \(\mu_o I/2l\). The key elements of using Ampere's law are

1. providing an argument for (a) why the magnetic field will be horizontal and independent of horizontal position (b) why the magnitude of the field will be the same at equal distances above and below the sheet, and (c) the direction of the field above and below the sheet
2. using Ampere's law to find the magnitude of the field, and
3. putting result from (1) and (2) together to get the total field.

Two parallel sheets with current flowing in the opposing directions will have an additive field in between the sheets and zero field outside of the sheets. So the total magnetic field inside the duct is \(\mu_o I/l\) and outside of the duct, the field is zero.

----

The duct has only an external self-inductance. (External inductance means inductance due to flux through a cross-section where there is no current.) The external self-inductance is due to the magnetic flux through the cross-sectional area \(A_1=h_1w\). The electromotive force across the gap is due to a change in magnetic flux

$$\mathcal{E}_1 = -\frac{\partial \Phi_m}{\partial t}$$

where \(\Phi_m\) is the magnetic flux. Compute this magnetic flux and re-write this equation in the form of

$$\mathcal{E_1} = -L_1 \frac{\partial I_1}{\partial t}$$

so as to find \(L_1\) in terms of \(\mu_o\), \(l\), and the cross-sectional area \(A_1=h_1w\).

**Answer**

$$\Phi_1 = \mu_o I_1 A_1/l$$

$$\mathcal{E}_1 = -\frac{\partial \Phi_1}{\partial t} = -\frac{\mu_o A_1}{l}\frac{\partial I_1}{\partial t}\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad L = \frac{\mu_o A_1}{l}$$
|}

-----

Two ducts are nested as shown in the bottom diagram at [https://www.mathcha.io/editor/K7MwPfWBUm3TXq8oNgtvEkvPecMwO6Oeu45ljV] such that their widths are essentially the same. The cross-sectional areas of each of the ducts are \(A_1=h_1w\) and \(A_2=h_2w\).

Compute \(\mathcal{E}_1\) and \(\mathcal{E}_2\) based on the time rate of change of flux through \(A_1\) and \(A_2\), respectively. Note that the flux through each of the cross-sectional areas includes flux due to the fields created by the current on one or more of the ducts. 

The total EMF that the current supplies need to maintain is 

$$\mathcal{E}=\mathcal{E}_1+\mathcal{E}_2$$

At low frequencies, we can assume that the total current on each of the ducts will be the same and uniformly distributed along \(l\). Call this current \(I\). (The power supplied is at any instant of time is \(\mathcal{E}_1I_1+\mathcal{E}_2I_2=\mathcal{E}I\). You are not asked to consider power in this problem, but it is referenced in the paper by Boykin in the [https://piazza.com/class/ke8nm0fjaej422?cid=59 Pizza thread].)

Find \(\mathcal{E}\) in terms of \(\mu_o\), \(l\), and the cross-sectional areas. Identifiy the inductance of this configuration.

**Answer**

The flux through the inner duct is the total field in the inner duct times the area of the duct. In the inner duct, \(B=2\mu_oI/l\) - the field from the current on the inner and outer duct in \(A_1\) are equal.

$$\Phi_1 = \frac{2\mu_oI}{l}A_1$$

The flux integral through the outer duct needs to be split into two parts to account for the fact that the field is not constant over the cross-section of \(A_2\). Over the \(A_1\) region, the field is \({2\mu_oI/l}\). The area outside of \(A_1\) has area \(A_2-A_1\) and a field \(\mu_oA/l\) that is due to the current on the outer duct only. The flux over the cross-section of \(A_2\) is

$$\Phi_2 = \frac{2\mu_oI}{l}A_1 + \frac{\mu_oI}{l}(A_2-A_1)$$

As instructed, 

$$\mathcal{E}=\mathcal{E_1} + \mathcal{E_2}$$

which simplifies to

$$\mathcal{E}=-\frac{\mu_o}{l}(3A_1+A_2)\frac{\partial I}{\partial t}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad L = \frac{\mu_o}{l}(3A_1+A_2)$$

This is the non-energy method that Boykin suggests for computing the inductance as an alternative to computing the internal and external fluxes and accounting for "flux linkages".

----

In part 3., the inductance was computed without reference to internal and external inductances. Compute the inductance of this configuration by computing the external inductance using the flux through \(A_1\) due to the field from both of the ducts and then find the internal flux using \(B_{21}(A_2-A_1)\), where \(B_{21}\) is the field in the region between ducts \(1\) and \(2\). (Based on the definition of "external inductance" given in part 2., one could argue that there is no "internal inductance" to be considered in this problem. However, in treating the regions \(A_2-A_1\) as internal, we are anticipating using \(h_2=h_1 + dh\) in the limit \(dh\rightarrow 0\) and then adding more ducts; in this limit, these fluxes would be internal differential fluxes.) 

Using these instructions, compute the inductance of the configuration. You should find that the inductance computed in this way is smaller than the inductance found in part 3. 

**Answer**

On the previous HW, several students attempted to compute the inductance of a co-axial cable by computing the internal inductance and internal inductance separately and then adding the result. This gives the wrong answer. As noted by Boykin, many textbooks get the correct answer by accounting for "flux linkages", but "flux linkages" is not often clearly defined and a physical justification for accounting for it is not provided. In this part, we compute the inductance without accounting for flux linkages and see that we get an answer different from part 3.

The internal inductance is computed using the flux through \(A_1\):

$$L_{int} = \frac{\Phi_{A_1}}{I} = \frac{\frac{2\mu_oI}{l}A_1}{I}=\frac{\mu_oA_1}{l}$$

The external inductance is computed using the flux through \(A_2-A_1\):

$$L_{ext} = \frac{\Phi_{A_2-A_1}}{2I} = \frac{\frac{\mu_oI}{l}(A_2-A_1)}{2I}=\frac{\mu_o(A_2-A_1)}{2l}$$

$$L=L_{int}+L_{ext}=\frac{\mu_o}{l}\frac{(A_1+A_2)}{2}$$

This differs from the answer to 3., which is

$$L = \frac{\mu_o}{l}(3A_1+A_2)$$

----

The inductance computed in 4. is smaller than that from 3. because all of the "flux linkages" were not considered in the calculation in part 4. Based on a comparison of your results in problems 3. and 4., explain what "flux linkage" means and or justify the \(I_{<}\) that I mentioned in the Piazza thread. You may also want to read the paper by Boykin, the scanned book pages in the [https://piazza.com/class/ke8nm0fjaej422?cid=59 Piazza thread], and the textbook where the first use of the term "flux linkage" is on page 189 in a section on mutual inductance. The energy method, using \(LI^2/2=\int B^2/2\mu_o\, dv\), can also be used to find the inductance of this configuration.

**Answer**

In the textbook on page 189 where flux linkages is first discussed, it is in a section on mutual inductance. To account for all of the "flux linkages" when computing the external flux means to account for all of the mutual inductances. The emf around the inner duct depends on the current (and hence field) created by both ducts. The emf around the outer duct also depends on the current (and hence field) created by both ducts. So the total inductance is

$$L = L_1 + L_2 + M_{12} + M_{21} = L_1 + L_2 + 2M_{12}$$

$$L_1 = \frac{\mu_o A_1}{l}$$

$$L_2 = \frac{\mu_o A_2}{l}$$

$$M_{12} = \frac{\Phi_1}{I_2} = \frac{\mu_o A_1}{l}$$

If we identify $$L_1$$ as the internal flux, then the external flux is

$$L_{ext} = L_2 + 2M_{12} = \frac{\mu_o}{l}(A_2 + 2A_1)$$

As a final check, we can use Poynting's theorem, which reduces to:

$$\int \mathbf{J}\cdot \mathbf{E}\, dv = -\frac{1}{2\mu_o}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\int B^2 dv$$

The left-hand side reduces to \(I\mathcal{E}_1 + I\mathcal{E_2} = I\mathcal{E}\) and the right-hand side is

$$-\frac{\mu_o}{l}(3A_1+A_2)I\frac{\partial I}{\partial t}$$

Equating the two gives

$$\mathcal{E} = -\frac{\mu_o}{l}(3A_1+A_2)\frac{\partial I}{\partial t}$$

from which we conclude 

$$L=\frac{\mu_o}{l}(3A_1+A_2)$$

In summary - on problems with a spatially distributed current, it is easier to use the energy formulation to find inductance. One can appeal to first principles to find the inductance and show that the energy formulation automatically accounts for mutual inductances.

# Multiple Impedances

In each of the \(k\)th segments (\(n=0, 1, 2\)) of the transmission line shown at [https://www.mathcha.io/editor/O4lYqspXSQqTP3ozGesgJy7BLHzgOmYjSZ2ez3V], the electric potential can be written in the form of a forward traveling voltage and a backward traveling voltage:
    
$$\widetilde{V}_n(z) = \widetilde{V}_{n}^+e^{-j\beta_n z}+\widetilde{V}_{n}^-e^{+j\beta_n z}$$
    
where the real potential is given by
    
$$V_n(z,t) = \text{Re}\Big[\widetilde{V}_n(z)e^{j\omega t}\Big]$$

Equivalently, the electric field in each dielectric region can be written in the form of a forward traveling electric field and a backward traveling electric field: 
    
$$\widetilde{E}_n(z) = \widetilde{E}_{n}^+e^{-jk_n z}+\widetilde{E}_{n}^-e^{+jk_n z}$$
    
where the real field is given by
    
$$E_n(z,t) = \text{Re}\Big[\widetilde{E}_n(z)e^{j\omega t}\Big]$$

Assume that \(\widetilde{V}_{0}^+\) is known. At \(z=0\) and \(z=\Delta\), the potential and current must be continuous (the equivalent conditions for the dielectric problem are that \(E\) and \(H\) are continuous). Assume also that region 2 extends extends to infinity so \(V_{2}^{-}=0\).

Find \(\widetilde{V}_{0}^-(z)\), \(\widetilde{V}_{1}^+(z)\), \(\widetilde{V}_{1}^-(z)\), and \(\widetilde{V}_{2}^+(z)\).

Find \(\widetilde{V}_{0}^-(z)\)/\(\widetilde{V}_{0}^+(z)\) and \(\widetilde{V}_{1}^-(z)\)/\(\widetilde{V}_{1}^+(z)\).

**Answer**

In each of the segments (\(n=0, 1, 2\)) of the transmission line shown at [https://www.mathcha.io/editor/O4lYqspXSQqTP3ozGesgJy7BLHzgOmYjSZ2ez3V], the electric potential can be written in the form of a forward traveling voltage and a backward traveling voltage:
    
$$\widetilde{V}_n(z) = \widetilde{V}_{n}^+e^{-j\beta_n z}+\widetilde{V}_{n}^-e^{+j\beta_n z}$$
    
where the real potential is given by
    
$$V_n(z,t) = \text{Re}\Big[\widetilde{V}_n(z)e^{j\omega t}\Big]$$

Equivalently, the electric field in each dielectric region can be written in the form of a forward traveling electric field and a backward traveling electric field: 
    
$$\widetilde{E}_n(z) = \widetilde{E}_{n}^+e^{-jk_n z}+\widetilde{E}_{n}^-e^{+jk_n z}$$
    
where the real field is given by
    
$$E_n(z,t) = \text{Re}\Big[\widetilde{E}_n(z)e^{j\omega t}\Big]$$

Assume that \(\widetilde{V}_{0}^+\) is known. At \(z=0\) and \(z=\Delta\), the potential and current must be continuous (the equivalent conditions for the dielectric problem are that \(E\) and \(H\) are continuous). Assume also that region 2 extends extends to infinity so \(V_{2}^{-}=0\).

Find \(\widetilde{V}_{0}^-(z)\), \(\widetilde{V}_{1}^+(z)\), \(\widetilde{V}_{1}^-(z)\), and \(\widetilde{V}_{2}^+(z)\).

Find \(\widetilde{V}_{0}^-(z)\)/\(\widetilde{V}_{0}^+(z)\) and \(\widetilde{V}_{1}^-(z)\)/\(\widetilde{V}_{1}^+(z)\).

In the following, I use \(x\) instead of \(z\) for the position coordinate. In addition, \(\widetilde{f}(x)\) means a complex function of the coordinate \(x\) and \(\widetilde{f}\) means a complex constant. For example, a spatially dependent reflection coefficient will be defined as \(\widetilde{\rho}(x)=\widetilde{\rho}e^{+2j\beta x}\).

The general equation for potential as a function of \(x\) is

$$\widetilde{V}_n(x) = \widetilde{V}_{n}^+e^{-j\beta_n x}+\widetilde{V}_{n}^-e^{+j\beta_n x}$$

This can be rewritten as

$$\widetilde{V}_n(x) = \widetilde{V}_{n}^+e^{-j\beta_n x}\left(1+\frac{\widetilde{V}_{n}^-}{\widetilde{V}_{n}^+}e^{+2j\beta_n x}\right)=\widetilde{V}_{n}^+e^{-j\beta_n x}\left(1+\widetilde{\rho}_ne^{+2j\beta_n x}\right)=\widetilde{V}_{n}^+e^{-j\beta_n x}\big[1+\widetilde{\rho}_n(x)\big]$$

The general equation for current as a function of \(x\) is

$$\widetilde{I}_n(x) = \frac{1}{Z_n}\left(\widetilde{V}_{n}^+e^{-j\beta_n x}-\widetilde{V}_{n}^-e^{+j\beta_n x}\right)$$

which can be rewritten as

$$\widetilde{I}_n(x) =\frac{\widetilde{V}_{n}^+}{Z_n}e^{-j\beta_n x}\left(1-\frac{\widetilde{V}_{n}^-}{\widetilde{V}_{n}^+}e^{+2j\beta_n x}\right)=\frac{\widetilde{V}_{n}^+}{Z_n}e^{-j\beta_n x}\left(1-\widetilde{\rho}_ne^{+2j\beta_n x}\right)=\frac{\widetilde{V}_{n}^+}{Z_n}e^{-j\beta_n x}\big[1-\widetilde{\rho}_n(x)\big]$$

At the interface, \(x_{n,n+1}\), between regions \(n\) and \(n+1\), the potential and current are continuous:

$$\widetilde{V}_n(x_{n,n+1}) = \widetilde{V}_{n+1}(x_{n,n+1})\quad\quad\widetilde{I}_n(x_{n,n+1}) = \widetilde{I}_{n+1}(x_{n,n+1})$$

as so is the spatially dependent impedance defined by 

$$Z_n(x)\equiv\frac{\widetilde{V}_n(x)}{\widetilde{I}_n(x)}=Z_n\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_n(x)}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_n(x)}$$

To simplify notation, set \(n=0\). When complete, generality can be restored by replacing \(0\) with \(n\) and \(1\) with \(n+1\). For \(n=0\), the interface conditions are

$$\widetilde{V}_0(x_{01}) = \widetilde{V}_{1}(x_{01})\quad\Rightarrow\quad\widetilde{V}_{0}^+e^{-j\beta_0 x_{01}}\big[1+\widetilde{\rho}_0(x_{01})\big]=\widetilde{V}_{1}^+e^{-j\beta_1 x_{01}}\big[1+\widetilde{\rho}_1(x_{01})\big]$$

$$\widetilde{I}_0(x_{01}) = \widetilde{I}_{1}(x_{01})\quad\Rightarrow\quad\frac{\widetilde{V}_{0}^+}{Z_0}e^{-j\beta_0 x_{01}}\big[1-\widetilde{\rho}_0(x_{01})\big]=\frac{\widetilde{V}_{1}^+}{Z_1^+}e^{-j\beta_1 x_{01}}\big[1-\widetilde{\rho}_1(x_{01})\big]$$

Taking the ratio of these two equations so as to eliminate \(\widetilde{V}_{0}^+\) and \(\widetilde{V}_{1}^+\) gives the equation for the continuity of \(Z(x)\) at the region 0/region 1 interface:

$$Z_0\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_0(x_{01})}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_0(x_{01})}=Z_1\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1(x_{01})}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1(x_{01})}$$

For the problem given, \(\widetilde{\rho}_2=0\) because \(\widetilde{V}_{2}^-=0\) was given. Incrementing the subscripts by \(1\) gives the equation for the continuity of \(Z(x)\) at the interface of regions \(1\) and \(2\):

$$Z_1\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1(x_{12})}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1(x_{12})}=Z_2\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_2(x_{12})}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_2(x_{12})}$$

With \(\widetilde{\rho}_2=0\) and \(x_{12}=\Delta\), this is

$$Z_1\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1(\Delta)}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1(\Delta)}=Z_2$$

and so

$$\widetilde{\rho}_1(\Delta)=\frac{Z_2-Z_1}{Z_2+Z_1}$$

Using the definition \(\widetilde{\rho}_n(x)\equiv \widetilde{\rho}_{n}e^{+2j\beta_n x}\),

$$\widetilde{\rho}_1e^{+2j\beta_1 \Delta}=\frac{Z_2-Z_1}{Z_2+Z_1}$$

and so the reflection coefficient for region \(1\) is:

$$\widetilde{\rho}_1=\frac{Z_2-Z_1}{Z_2+Z_1}e^{-2j\beta_1 \Delta}$$
 
To find the reflection coefficient \(\widetilde{\rho}_0\), continuity of impedance can be used at the interface between regions \(0\) and \(1\):

$$Z_0\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_0(x_{01})}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_0(x_{01})}=Z_1\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1(x_{01})}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1(x_{01})}$$

With \(x_{01}=0\), and using \(\widetilde{\rho}_n(0)=\widetilde{\rho}_n\), this is

$$Z_0\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_0}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_0}=Z_1\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1}$$

This is simplified if the spatially dependent impedance notation is used for the right-hand side

$$Z_0\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_0}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_0}=Z_1(0)$$

Solving for \(\widetilde{\rho}_0\) gives

$$\widetilde{\rho}_0=\frac{Z_1(0)-Z_0}{Z_1(0)+Z_0}$$

Using \(Z_1(0)=Z_1[1+\widetilde{\rho}_1(0)]/[1-\widetilde{\rho}_1(0)]=Z_1(1+\widetilde{\rho}_1)/(1-\widetilde{\rho}_1)\) gives

$$\widetilde{\rho}_0=\frac{Z_1\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1}-Z_0}{Z_1\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1}+Z_0}$$

In summary, the reflection ratios for all of the regions have been found given the reflection ratio in one region.

$$\frac{\widetilde{V}_1^-}{\widetilde{V}_1^+}=\widetilde{\rho}_1=\frac{Z_2-Z_1}{Z_2+Z_1}e^{-2j\beta_1 \Delta}\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad \frac{\widetilde{V}_1^-(x)}{\widetilde{V}_1^+(x)}=\widetilde{\rho}_1(x)=\frac{Z_2-Z_1}{Z_2+Z_1}e^{-2j\beta_1 (\Delta-x)}$$

$$\frac{\widetilde{V}_0^-}{\widetilde{V}_0^+}=\widetilde{\rho}_0=\frac{Z_1\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1}-Z_0}{Z_1\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1}+Z_0}\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad \frac{\widetilde{V}^-_0(x)}{\widetilde{V}_0^+(x)}=\widetilde{\rho}_0(x)=\frac{Z_1\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1}-Z_0}{Z_1\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1}+Z_0}e^{2j\beta_1 x}$$

----

To find the values for the potentials given their ratios, go back to the continuity equation for potential at the first interface.

$$\widetilde{V}_{1}(x_{01})=\widetilde{V}_0(x_{01})\quad\Rightarrow\quad\widetilde{V}_{1}^+e^{-j\beta_1 x_{01}}\big[1+\widetilde{\rho}_1(x_{01})\big]=\widetilde{V}_{0}^+e^{-j\beta_0 x_{01}}\big[1+\widetilde{\rho}_0(x_{01})\big]$$

In this problem, \(\widetilde{V}_{0}^+\) was given. Solving for  \(\widetilde{V}_{1}^+\) gives

$$\widetilde{V}_{1}^+=\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_0(x_{01})}{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1(x_{01})}\widetilde{V}_{0}^+e^{-j(\beta_0-\beta_1) x_{01}}=\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_0}{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1}\widetilde{V}_{0}^+$$

The solution for \(\widetilde{V}_{2}^+\) is found by incrementing the subscripts in this equation by \(1\).

$$\widetilde{V}_{2}^+=\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1(x_{12})}{1+\widetilde{\rho}_2(x_{12})}\widetilde{V}_{1}^+e^{-j(\beta_1-\beta_2) x_{12}}=\big[1+\widetilde{\rho}_1(\Delta)\big]\widetilde{V}_{1}^+e^{-j(\beta_1-\beta_2) \Delta}$$

$$\widetilde{V}_{0}^-=\widetilde{\rho}_0\widetilde{V}_{0}^+=\widetilde{V}_{0}^+\frac{Z_1\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1}-Z_0}{Z_1\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1}+Z_0}$$

$$\widetilde{V}_{1}^-=\widetilde{\rho}_1\widetilde{V}_{1}^+=\widetilde{V}_{0}^+\frac{Z_2-Z_1}{Z_2+Z_1}e^{-2j\beta_1 \Delta}$$

----

$$\frac{\widetilde{V}^-_0(x)}{\widetilde{V}_0^+(x)}=\widetilde{\rho}_0(x)=\frac{Z_1\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1}-Z_0}{Z_1\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1}+Z_0}e^{2j\beta_1 x}$$

$$\widetilde{V}_{2}^+(x)=\widetilde{V}_{0}^+\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_0}{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1}\big[1+\widetilde{\rho}_1(\Delta)\big]e^{-j(\beta_1-\beta_2) \Delta}e^{-j\beta_1 x}$$

The general procedure followed above was

1. Starting at the load interface \(x_{n-1,n}\) where \(Z_n(x_{n-1,n})\) is known because \(\widetilde{\rho}_n\) is known, find all of the reflection coefficients by iteratively using the impedance continuity condition, which followed from the continuity of \(\widetilde{V}(x)\) and \(\widetilde{I}(x)\)

$$Z_{n-1}(x_{n-1,n})=Z_n(x_{n-1,n})$$

until \(n=1\). Explicitly, the equation to be iterated can be found by solving 

$$Z_{n-1}\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_{n-1}(x_{n-1,n})}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_{n-1}(x_{n-1,n})}=Z_{n}\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_{n}(x_{n-1,n})}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_{n}(x_{n-1,n})}$$

for \(\widetilde\rho_{n-1}\)

$$\widetilde\rho_{n-1}=e^{-2j\beta_{n-1}x_{n-1,n}}\frac{\frac{Z_n}{Z_{n-1}}\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_n(x_{n-1,n})}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_n(x_{n-1,n})}-1}{\frac{Z_n}{Z_{n-1}}\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_n(x_{n-1,n})}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_n(x_{n-1,n})}+1}$$

2. Starting at the interface between the first two regions (source region 0 and region 1), where \(\widetilde{V}^+_{0}\) is known, iterate

$$\widetilde{V}_{n+1}^+=\widetilde{V}_{n}^+\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_n(x_{n,n+1})}{1+\widetilde{\rho}_{n+1}(x_{n,n+1})}e^{-j(\beta_n-\beta_{n+1}) x_{n,n+1}}$$

----

A common requirement of power systems is that there is no reflected potential, which corresponds to \(\widetilde{V}_{0}^-=0\) and \(\widetilde\rho_{0}=0\). Given a fixed impedance for the source and load, and impedance and width of a region between the source and load can be adjusted to make \(\widetilde{V}_{0}^-=0\). To do this, one needs to solve

$$\widetilde\rho_{0}=0=\frac{\frac{Z_1}{Z_{0}}\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1}-1}{\frac{Z_1}{Z_{0}}\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1}+1}$$

which simplifies to

$$0=\frac{Z_1}{Z_{0}}\frac{1+\widetilde{\rho}_1}{1-\widetilde{\rho}_1}-1$$

Using

$$\widetilde\rho_{1}=e^{2j\beta_{1}\Delta}\frac{Z_2-Z_1}{Z_2+Z_1}$$

and simplifying gives

$$e^{-2j\beta_1\Delta}\frac{Z_2-Z_1}{Z_1+Z_2}=\frac{Z_0-Z_1}{Z_0+Z_1}$$

The two unknowns in this equation are \(\Delta\) and \(Z_1\) can be solved for by equating the real and imaginary parts. In the case where all of the impedances are real (corresponding to propagation with no resistance), \(e^{-2j\beta_1\Delta}\) must be real, so

$$2\beta_1\Delta = m\pi$$

Using \(\beta_1=2\pi/\lambda_1\) gives the requirement

$$\Delta=m\frac{\lambda_1}{4}\quad m=0,1,...$$

The needed impedance \(Z_1\) is found by solving

$$\pm\frac{Z_2-Z_1}{Z_1+Z_2}=\frac{Z_0-Z_1}{Z_0+Z_1}$$

where \(+\) corresponds to \(m=0,2,...\) and \(-\) corresponds to \(m=1, 3, ...\) and 

Expanding gives

$$\pm (-Z_1^2 - Z_0Z_1 + Z_1Z_2 + Z_0Z_2)=Z_0Z_2+Z_0Z_1-Z_1Z_2-Z_1^2$$

For the \(+\) case, the solution is trivial: \(Z_1=Z_0\), which corresponds to no intermediate region.

For the \(-\) case, corresponding to \(m=1, 3, ...\),

$$Z_1=\sqrt{Z_0Z_2}$$

so that the impedance is the geometric mean of the load and source impedances. 

In summary, given a fixed source and load impedance, a transmission line with a length that is an odd multiple of \(\lambda/4\) and impedance that is the geometric mean of the source and load impedance can be placed between the source and the load to ensure no reflected wave in the source region.

----

1. Show that

$$V(z,t)=V^{+}\Big[\cos(\omega t-\beta z) + \rho\cos(\omega t+\beta z)\Big]$$

can be written as the sum of two standing waves:

$$V(z,t)=A\cos(\omega t)\cos(\beta z) + B\sin(\omega t)\sin(\beta z)$$

and find \(A\) and \(B\).

2. The following program shows a wave of amplitude \(V^+=1\) generated at the left boundary traveling to the right.

```
Nx = 300;
x = [1:Nx];
lambda = 100;

figure(1);clf
for i = 1:500
    Ei = cos(2*pi*(x-i)/lambda);
    % Set values to right of wave front to NaN so they won't be plotted.
    Ei(i+1:end) = NaN; 

    % Plot current time step as light grey.
    plot(Ei,'k','LineWidth',1,'Color',[1,1,1,0.4]/2);
    % Keep past time steps
    hold on;
    grid on;
    if i > 1
        % Delete previous current time step thick black line
        delete(h)
    end
    % Plot current time step as thick black line
    h = plot(Ei,'k','LineWidth',2);
    
    set(gca,'Ylim',[-2,2]);
    set(gca,'Xlim',[1,Nx]);
    %legend('V^{+}');
    % Uncomment the following to hide past time steps
    %hold off;
    if mod(i,100) == 0
        % Allow early termination of animation
        input('Continue?');
    end
    drawnow;
end
```

Modify the program so that a wave of amplitude \(V^-=1/2\) is generated at the right boundary travels to the left. You are welcome to write re-write this program and your answer in another programming language.

3. Discuss how this plot is related to the VSWR. Could \(\rho\) be determined using only this plot?

4. Repeat 2. and 3. with the right boundary at \(i_x=550\).

# Final

Due Tuesday, December 15th at 11:59 pm.

In Section 5.2 (page 214) of the text and in class, the partial differential equations for \(V\) and \(I\) for a transmission line were derived using Maxwell's equations and the assumption that the length scale of variations in \(V\) and \(I\) was much longer than the separation distance between the conducting plates or cylinder that formed the transmission line; see Figure 5.2 on page 215 for the case of conducting parallel plates. (The length scale assumption allowed us to assume that the fields had the same spatial dependence as a problem with a uniform current and charge distribution on the conductors.)

The partial differential equations derived from Maxwell's equations were equivalent to the equations from a ladder circuit containing repeated ''differential'' nodes (containing inductors and capacitors) of the form shown in Figure 5.2 on page 215.

Given the above, it seems reasonable to expect that a ladder circuit with enough ''discrete'' nodes can approximate a continuous transmission line. Such a circuit is called an artificial transmission line.

In this problem, you will compute how \(V\), \(I\), and \(Z\) vary along an artificial transmission line and compare the results with the respective values for a continuous transmission line.

**Partial Answer**

In the time domain, the voltage across the inductor is

$$V_1(t)-V_0(t) = -L\dot{I_1}(t)$$

At node \(1\), KCL gives

$$I_2(t)=I_1(t)-I_C(t)$$

where \(I_C\) is the current along the wire connected to the capacitor. Using \(Q_C=CV_C\), \(\dot{Q}_C=I_C=C\dot{V}_C\),

$$I_2(t)=I_1(t)-C\dot{V}_C(t)$$

Steady state solutions to a system of linear first-order ODEs can be found efficiently (instead of using, say, the method of undetermined coefficients) by assuming solutions of the form

$$V_k(t) = \text{Re}\Big[\widetilde{V}_ke^{j\omega t}\Big]$$

$$I_k(t) = \text{Re}\Big[\widetilde{I}_ke^{j\omega t}\Big]$$

Using this and substation into \(V_1(t)-V_0(t) = -L\dot{I_1}(t)\) gives

$$\text{Re}\Big[\widetilde{V}_1e^{j\omega t}-\widetilde{V}_0e^{j\omega t} + L\widetilde{I}_1e^{j\omega t}\Big]=0$$

or

$$\text{Re}\Big[e^{j\omega t}(\widetilde{V}_1-\widetilde{V}_0 + L\widetilde{I}_1)\Big]=0$$

In order for an equation of the form

$$\text{Re}\Big[\widetilde{C}e^{j\omega t}\Big]=0$$

to be true for all \(t\), \(\widetilde{C}=0\). As a result, the relationship between the complex coefficients is

$$\widetilde{V}_1-\widetilde{V}_0 = -L\widetilde{I}_1$$

The other equations can be obtained using the same arguments used to arrive at this result. 

----

\(Z_1\) is found by adding the impedance of the load and inductor in series to get and equivalent impedance of \(Z_L+j\omega L\). This impedance is in parallel with a capacitor, so the total equivalent impedance is

$$\frac{1}{Z_1}=\frac{1}{Z_C} + \frac{1}{Z_L+j\omega L}$$

where the impedance of the capacitor is \(1/j\omega C\). Substitution and re-writing gives

\(Z_1=\frac{1}{j\omega C + \frac{1}{Z_L+j\omega L}}\)

This impedance is in series with an inductor, so 

\(Z_0=Z_1 + j\omega L\)

One could also arrive at the equation for \(Z_0\) by solving the four equations from the previous part for \(\widetilde{V}_0/\widetilde{I}_1\).

----

As in the problems for transmission lines, we find the impedance at the source by working from the source to the load (or a region transition). Then, the voltages and currents are found by working from the source towards the load. The impedance was found in the previous problem. We can plug \(\widetilde{I}_1=\widetilde{V}_0/Z_0\)

into the equation

$$\widetilde{V}_1=\widetilde{V}_0-j\omega L\widetilde{I}_1$$

and solve for \(\widetilde{V}_1\) in terms of \(\widetilde{V}_0\). Then, we can use

$$\widetilde{I}_2=\widetilde{I}_1-j\omega C\widetilde{V}_1$$

to find \(\widetilde{I}_2\) in terms of \(\widetilde{V}_0\). Finally,

$$\widetilde{V}_2=Z_L\widetilde{I}_2$$

The answers can be verified by

1. Using limits - do your equations give the expected results when \(\omega \rightarrow 0\) or \(\omega \rightarrow \infty\)? What about similar limits for \(L\) and \(C\)?
2. Solving the 4x4 system of equations manually
3. Using a program such as Wolfram Alpha to solve the system of equations. MATLAB also has this capability with its Symbolic Math Toolkit.
4. Find a circuit simulation program and choose arbitrary values of the parameters and verify that the amplitudes and phases from the simulation match your calculations. You can find simple programs that work online [https://www.falstad.com/circuit/] [https://www.circuitlab.com/] and do not require a license or software installation. See also [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_electronics_circuit_simulators] [https://www.electronics-lab.com/top-ten-online-circuit-simulators/]
5. Use something like MATLAB's Simulink or PSpice. There are many other options.

----

$$Z_{k-1} = \frac{1}{ \frac{1}{Z_{k} + j\omega L}+ j\omega C }$$

The equations

$$\widetilde{V}_1=\widetilde{V}_0-j\omega L\widetilde{I}_1$$

$$\widetilde{I}_2=\widetilde{I}_1-j\omega C\widetilde{V}_1$$

generalize to

$$\widetilde{V}_{k+1}=\widetilde{V}_k-j\omega L\widetilde{I}_{k+1}$$

$$\widetilde{I}_{k+1}=\widetilde{I}_k-j\omega C\widetilde{V}_k$$

The above equations were used in the program. In the program, I compare a plot of \(Z_k\) and \(\widetilde{V}_k/\widetilde{I}_k\) as they should be identical.

The procedure of solution is to start with \(k=0\) and solve the first equation. Then A. use the second equation with \(k=1\) to get \(\widetilde{I}_2\) and B. substitute this into the first equation when \(k=1\) to get \(\widetilde{V}_2\).  Steps A. and B. are then repeated for \(k=2, ...\).

The problem statement asks for the answer in a different form.  The two generalized equations above can be re-written as

$$\widetilde{V}_{k+1}=\widetilde{V}_k(1-\omega^2LC)-j\omega L\widetilde{I}_{k}$$

$$\widetilde{I}_{k+1}=\widetilde{I}_k(1+\omega^2LC)-j\omega C\widetilde{V}_{k+1}$$

Or, the indexing can be adjusted by subtracting 1 from the \(\widetilde{I}_{k}\) index. (In the diagram, there would be currents \(\widetilde{I}_{0}\) and \(\widetilde{I}_{1}\) instead of \(\widetilde{I}_{1}\) and \(\widetilde{I}_{2}\).) Then,

$$\widetilde{V}_{k+1}=\widetilde{V}_k-j\omega L\widetilde{I}_{k}$$

$$\widetilde{I}_{k+1}=\widetilde{I}_k-j\omega C\widetilde{V}_{k+1}$$

----

Ideally the justification of 1. and 2. were done by plotting the continuous solution's impedance, \(\widetilde{V}_k\), and \(V_k(t)\) which is hinted at given the questions asked earlier. In the case of 1., an animation of \(V_k(t)\) will show a rightward traveling wave. In the case of 2., and animation of \(V_k(t)\) will show a waveform that looks like the solution studied in previous HWs when there is a reflection. The standing wave ratio could be computed for the discrete case and compared with the continuous case. One could look at the case where \(Z_L>\sqrt{L/C}\) and \(Z_L<\sqrt{L/C}\) and ask if the solutions match expectations. Most students looked at how the magnitudes changed with respect to the node number but did not consider how the phase changed (it changes approximately linearly; one can phase shift a signal with such a circuit). One could also look at how \(Z_k\) depends on \(k\) for a case where \(Z_L\ne \sqrt{L/C}\) and compare this to the spatially dependent impedance for the continuous case.

The continuous solution was derived in 5.2 of the textbook. A key assumption is that the wavelength is large. In the discrete case, the number of nodes per wavelength should be large so that there are many differential elements per wavelength. The wavelength is inversely proportional to \(\omega\) and so smaller \(\omega\) gives a larger number of nodes per wave. This can be justified with plots by showing how the difference between the continuous solution and the discrete solution depends on \(\omega\).

The code given in the solution can be built upon to do all that is suggested above. Note that the discrete case does not have an intrinsic length scale. The number of nodes per wavelength is not an independent parameter that can be set as one would do in a typical numerical solution.

In the top circuit at [https://www.mathcha.io/editor/XoxD9fqLS21Tw635VQierrkQgIZG9nPVSWP6Lr], the source varies according to \(V_0\cos\omega t\).

Use the methods of Section 4.3 (which starts on page 177) to show that

$$\widetilde{V}_1=\widetilde{V}_0-j\omega L\widetilde{I}_1$$

$$\widetilde{I}_2=\widetilde{I}_1-j\omega C\widetilde{V}_1$$

$$\widetilde{V}_2=\widetilde{V}_1-j\omega L\widetilde{I}_2$$

$$\widetilde{I}_2=\frac{\widetilde{V}_2}{Z_L}$$

-----

One can find all of the unknown values of \(\widetilde{I}\) and \(\widetilde{V}\) using the previous equations given only \(\widetilde{V}_0=V_0\). An alternative relationship can also be used:

$$\widetilde{I}_1=\frac{\widetilde{V}_0}{Z_0}$$

where \(Z_0\) is the equivalent impedance of the entire circuit.

Defining \(Z_1\) as the equivalent impedance of \(Z_L\) and the capacitor connected to node 1 and the inductor between node 1 and 2, find \(Z_1\) and then \(Z_0\).

----

1. Find \(\widetilde{I}_k\) for \(k=1, 2\) and \(\widetilde{V}_k\) for \(k=1, 2\).
2. Find \(I_k(t)\) for \(k=1, 2\) and \(V_k(t)\) for \(k=1, 2\).

At this point, it will be useful to verify that your answers are correct because the equations will be generalized. 

Describe how you verified your answers.

----

To solve this problem generally for \(N\) ladder elements as shown in the bottom circuit at [https://www.mathcha.io/editor/XoxD9fqLS21Tw635VQierrkQgIZG9nPVSWP6Lr]

1. Write an equation that relates \(Z_{k-1}\) to \(Z_{k}\), \(\omega\), \(L\), and \(C\) that applies for all but the last node;
2. Write an equation that relates \(\widetilde{V}_{k+1}\) to \(\widetilde{V}_{k}\) and \(\widetilde{I}_{k}\);
3. Write an equation that relates \(\widetilde{I}_{k+1}\) to \(\widetilde{I}_{k}\) and \(\widetilde{V}_{k+1}\);
4. Write a program that takes an input of \(\omega\), \(L\), \(C\), \(N\), \(Z_L\), and \(V_0\) and returns
   1. \(Z_k\) for \(k=0, 1, ..., N-1\) (These node-dependent impedances are analogous to the position-dependent impedances previously considered. Note that in the last homework, the subscripts corresponded to segments of a transmission line. Here, the subscripts correspond to a position along a single transmission line.)
   2. \(\widetilde{I}_k\) for \(k=1, ..., N\)
   3. \(\widetilde{V}_k\) for \(k=1, 2, ..., N\)

Note that \(Z_N=Z_L\) by definition.

## Part II

For this part, use \(V_0=1\) V, \(L=1\) H, \(C=1\) F, \(\omega=0.005\) s\(^{-1}\), and \(N=1000\).

1. Plot \(V_k(t)\) at \(t=0\).
2. Plot \(V_k(t)\) at \(t=(2\pi/\omega)/4\).

Justify the following claims using plots that compare the discrete ladder circuit solution with the exact solution.

1. When \(Z_L=\sqrt{L/C}\), the ladder network solution is a discrete approximation to an infinitely long continuous transmission line with a characteristic impedance of \(\sqrt{L/C}\)<sup>*</sup>. (Note that the ladder network only gives a solution in a finite region near the source, similar to an FDTD simulation with a source on the left and a simulation domain with a constant \(\mu\) and \(\epsilon\) - the wave appears to continue to propagate past the right boundary. Here \(Z_L\) is analogous to the right boundary in the FDTD simulation.)

2. When \(Z_L\ne \sqrt{L/C}\), the ladder network solution is a discrete approximation of the source region of a continuous transmission line that has a change in characteristic impedance.

3. The discrete approximation to the continuous solution is better for small \(\omega\).

<sup>*</sup> If you are wondering how a circuit containing only inductive and capacitive elements can have a real impedance, see [https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_22.html Section 22-6 of the Feynman Lectures on Physics] - "In a circuit of this kind, energy is continually absorbed from the generator at a constant rate and flows constantly out into the network, supplying energy which is stored in the inductances and capacitances down the line." In the limit of \(\omega\rightarrow 0\), \(z_0\) in [https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_22.html equation 22.28] becomes \(\sqrt{L/C}\).
